            <h2>CS department adds new certificate</h2>
            <p>
                As the demand for programming classes continues to rise, the Department of Computer Science has added a
                new programming
                certificate, which aims to make programming accessible for students with interests in a variety of
                fields.

            <h2>Quality programming requires complex intellectual skill sets to best get the job done. Learn some tips
                from an industry
                expert on how to establish a true developer mindset.</h2>
            <p>
                I've worked with developers for years in my capacity as a system administrator and I've known some truly
                unique and
                brilliant personalities. Frankly, I've found myself envious of people working in a discipline often
                committed to "single
                tasking" rather than the constant multi-tasking my duties entail, even though the single task may be
                incredibly complex.
